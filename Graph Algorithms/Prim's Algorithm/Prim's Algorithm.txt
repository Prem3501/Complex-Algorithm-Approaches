Write a program to find a minimum spanning tree from the given weighted and undirected Graph. Use Prim's Algorithm to solve this.

Example

Input

5

0 2 0 6 0

2 0 3 8 5

0 3 0 0 7

6 8 0 0 9

0 5 7 9 0

Output

0 1 2

1 2 3

0 3 6

1 4 5

Explanation

Visit all the node with shortest path. Shortest path from 0 - 1 is 2, 1- 2 is 3, next shortest path is 0- 3 is 6 and 1-4 is 5 . Now all the nodes are visited.

Input format :
The first line of input represents the number of vertices V.

The next V*V Matrix represents the adjacency matrix.

Output format :
Output prints the starting node, ending node, and edge weight of the minimum spanning tree.

Refer to the sample input and output for formatting specifications
