Find shortest paths from source to all vertices in the given graph using Dijkstra's algorithm.

Example

Input

0 4 0 0 0

4 0 8 0 0

0 8 0 7 0

0 0 7 0 9

0 0 0 9 0

0

Output

Vertex 	 Distance from Source

0 		 				0

1 		 				4

2 		 				12

3 		 				19

4 		 				28

Explanation

Calculate the shortest path from 0 to all remaining nodes using 0 as the source node. The shortest path is from node 0 to node1 is 4. To get to node 2, go from node 0 to node 1 (distance 4) and then from node 1 to node 2 (distance 8). The total distance is 12 . Repeat the process until all the nodes are visited.



Input format :
Adjacency matrix

Source vertex

Output format :
Use below spacing format to print the output

printf("Vertex \t Distance from Source\n"); 

printf("%d \t\t %d\n", i, dist[i]); 

Code constraints :
V = 5

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
0 4 0 0 0
4 0 8 0 0
0 8 0 7 0
0 0 7 0 9
0 0 0 9 0
0
Output 1 :
Vertex 	 Distance from Source
0 		 0
1 		 4
2 		 12
3 		 19
4 		 28
