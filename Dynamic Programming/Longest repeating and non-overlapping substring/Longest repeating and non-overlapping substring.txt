Given string str, find the longest repeating non-overlapping substring in it. In other words, find 2 identical substrings of maximum length which do not overlap. If there exists more than one such substring return any of them. Write a program for the same.



Example:

Input: 

str = "aabaabaaba"

Output: 

aaba

Input format :
The input consists of a string.

Output format :
The output prints the longest repeating non-overlapping substring in it.

Code constraints :
Use Dynamic Programming

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
malayalam
Output 1 :
ala
Input 2 :
aabaabaaba
Output 2 :
aaba
