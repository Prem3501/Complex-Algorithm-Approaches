Sample Input

4

4 3 2 6

Sample Output

29

Explanation

First, connect ropes of lengths 2 and 3  which will be combined as a node (2+3) = 5. Now we have three ropes of lengths 4, 6, and 5. 
Now connect ropes of lengths 4 and 5 which will be combined as a node (4+5) = 9. Now we have two ropes of lengths 6 and 9. 
Finally, connect the two ropes and all ropes have connected.
