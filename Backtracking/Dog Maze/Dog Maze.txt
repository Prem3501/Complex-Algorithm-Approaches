A dog has to move from starting point to it's end point where 1 represent free space and 0 represented blocked area.Print the path from 0,0 to n-1, n-1 if exists or print -1;



Gray blocks are blocked so that dog cant move to that area.



the above image is the solution or way from staring point to end point.



Note : Direction towards right and towards bottom.

Input format :
First line contains N.

Next N lines contains space separated integers.

Output format :
Output the solution_matrix if the destination point is reached.

Code constraints :
0<=N<=5

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
4
1 0 0 0
1 1 0 1  
0 1 0 0
1 1 1 1
