Write a program to count the number of a subset of elements that are selected from a given set whose sum adds up to a given number K. We are considering the set contains non-negative values. It is assumed that the input set is unique (no duplicates are presented).

Example

Input

4

1 3 5 2

6

Output

2

Explanation

Subset1={1,5} , Subset2={1,3,2} . 1+5 = 6 , 1+3+2 = 6 . 



Input format :
The first line of the input consists of the value of n.

The next n inputs are the array elements.

The last input is the sum.

Output format :
The output prints the count.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
4
1 3 5 2
6
Output 1 :
2
