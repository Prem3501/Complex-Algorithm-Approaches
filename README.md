# Complex Algorithm Approaches

  Every problem has question with answer and they are extracted from various sources, make sure you check out and verify your clarity. This is my one of the approaches, which i used solving the problem there are also many other approaches and can be even a optimized one, In that case, feel free to make pull requests to enhance the code.
