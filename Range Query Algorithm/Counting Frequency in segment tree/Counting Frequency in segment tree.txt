You are given an array of integers, and you need to perform frequency count queries on it. The array is 0-indexed, meaning that elements are referred to by their position starting from 0. You are required to implement a program that can answer queries of the following type:



Frequency Query: Given a range [L, R] (0-based indices) and an integer value X, find the frequency of the integer X within the elements located in the specified range [L, R] (inclusive). Write a program to handle these queries efficiently using a segment tree.

Input format :
First line represents the size of Segment tree

Second line represents the elements

Third line represents the range (start and end)

Last line represents the element gonna find the frequency

Output format :
Refer sample output

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
1 2 2 3 4
1 3
2
Output 1 :
Frequency of 2 in the range [1, 3] is: 2
Input 2 :
5
1 2 3 4 5
1 3
6
Output 2 :
Frequency of 6 in the range [1, 3] is: 0
